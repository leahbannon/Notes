##Ben Balter

Writing software is hard enough as it is. We don't want to lock it down more. If you look at the OS community, they don't have policy and admin constraints, just a lot of people passionate about building OS software.

How do we optimize for the developer?

GitHub takes the tools of the OS community and brings it to your enterprise/agency.

You're optimizing for collaboration. Making easier for people to work together than alone. A bunch of people need to get together to do something awesome. Make their experience a good one.

*Electronic: Avoid the information inbalance. You don't have to be in the room to know why a decision was made. Online is high fidelity medium where process is exposed. In OS, every decision has a URL. Here's the entire convo where we decided the merits of that decision.
*Asynchronous: Empowers asynchronous work. That way you don't have roadblocks of time. 
*Lock-Free: Don't have to wait for a superior. I don't have to ask for permission to rapidly experiment with something. We can take forever to discuss and contemplate, or I can quickly build a proto-type and we can debate its merits.
